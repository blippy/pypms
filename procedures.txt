TROUBLESHOOTING

ERR101: No job code NNN
Occurs when running invsummary.
Maybe it has found an expense/invoice for a job that isn't in PMS.
Check that the job code is correct, and that you have set up a job with at least one active task for that job.
You will need to rerun post.py before attempting to rerun invsummary again.

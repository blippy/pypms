PROCEDURES


Month-end procedures:

Start pypms.bat

run pypms.py

run post.py (in progress) (quite a dangerous facility)

run invsummary.py - produces the invoice summary
Examine reports\monthrec.txt. Ensure that there are no diffs.
Examine reports\invoices.xls. Ensure it matches with monthrec.txt and PMS

Perform any manual adjustments to tblInvoice you require

run recoveries.py - spots recoveries in PMS

run health.py, and give results to Jon. The figures do not have to be 100%.
Outputs: reports\health.txt

run mobil.py (in progress)
Outputs: reports\mobil.txt

Utility extras:
* unpost - to eliminate a month from tblInvoice (be careful - it will zap a month)
* health - report that Jon needs for his stats

TROUBLESHOOTING

ERR101: No job code NNN
Occurs when running invsummary.
Maybe it has found an expense/invoice for a job that isn't in PMS.
Check that the job code is correct, and that you have set up a job with at least one active task for that job.
You will need to rerun post.py before attempting to rerun invsummary again.

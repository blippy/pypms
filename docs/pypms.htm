This is in a directory derived from the first day of the reporting
period. Hereinafter, this directory will be referred to as $OUTDIR.</li>

few minutes. When they are finished, you are advised of this fact.

<h2>Output</h2>

Output is sent to $OUTDIR, as described in section Usage.&nbsp; There
are 3 types of output:<br>

<ol>

  <li>client-targetted timesheets - these are pdfs of the form
CODE-EE.pdf , where CODE is the job code, EE is the employee initials.
They are in a form suitable for submission to clients. It is not
expected that all of these files will be of interest to clients.</li>

  <li>people.txt - a summary of all of the employees time allocation
for the period. Thiis can be used by the secretary to cross-check
overtime allowances.</li>

  <li>intermediary and internal information files - anything other than
the above. There may exist a file called exception.txt, whose existence
indicates that a fatal error occurred in the processing, and whose
contents give a traceback of the error encountered. Only a developer is
expected to inderstand the output.</li>

</ol>
